<h1>📊 Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard - Business Intelligence Project</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

A comprehensive Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard built using Tableau to analyze customer behavior and identify key drivers of churn. This project uses a dataset of 64,374 customers to uncover trends in payment behavior, usage frequency, and contract structure, enabling data-driven retention strategies.

The dashboard highlights overall churn rate (47.37%), churn distribution, contract-based churn differences, payment delay risk thresholds, and engagement-related churn patterns. It demonstrates how business intelligence techniques can be applied to customer analytics to reduce attrition and improve customer lifetime value.

<h2>Key Business Insights</h2>

- <b>Contract Risk:</b> Monthly contracts exhibit the highest churn rate (51.6%), indicating greater short-term customer instability.
- <b>Payment Behavior:</b> Churn increases sharply after 15+ days of payment delay, revealing a critical behavioral risk threshold.
- <b>Engagement Levels:</b> Low usage frequency customers show significantly higher churn compared to moderately engaged users.
- <b>Stabilization Point:</b> Churn levels begin to stabilize after moderate usage frequency, suggesting engagement reduces churn risk.

<h2>Strategic Recommendations</h2>

- <b>Proactive Retention:</b> Implement alerts for customers exceeding 15 days of payment delay.
- <b>Engagement Campaigns:</b> Target low-usage customers with personalized incentives.
- <b>Contract Optimization:</b> Encourage transitions from monthly to longer-term contracts.
- <b>Predictive Monitoring:</b> Leverage behavioral thresholds to build churn prediction models.
