<h1>Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard – Business Intelligence Project</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This project presents a Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard built in Tableau to identify behavioral and contract-based drivers of customer attrition.
</p>

<p>
Using a dataset of 64,374 customers, the analysis explores how payment behavior, usage frequency, and contract type influence churn risk. The dashboard highlights key churn thresholds and patterns that can inform targeted retention strategies.
</p>

<p>
The objective of this project was to simulate a real-world telecom churn analysis and apply business intelligence principles to uncover actionable insights.

<h2>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Total Customers:</strong> 64,374</li>

<h2>Dashboard Structure</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Overall churn metrics</li>
  <li>Customer distribution by churn status</li>
  <li>Churn rate by contract type</li>
  <li>Churn rate by payment delay</li>

<h2>Key Business Insights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Customers on <strong>monthly contracts</strong> exhibit the highest churn rate (51.6%), indicating short-term commitment risk.</li>
  <li>A sharp increase in churn occurs after <strong>15+ days of payment delay</strong>, suggesting a critical behavioral risk threshold.</li>
  <li>Customers with <strong>low usage frequency</strong> demonstrate significantly higher churn rates compared to more engaged users.</li>
  <li>Engagement stabilizes after moderate usage levels, where churn begins to level off.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Strategic Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Implement proactive outreach for customers exceeding 15 days of payment delay.</li>
  <li>Develop engagement campaigns targeting low-usage customers.</li>
  <li>Offer incentives for transitioning from monthly to longer-term contracts.</li>
  <li>Use behavioral thresholds to build predictive churn monitoring systems.</li>
